                <p>My name is WAI SUN LAM. Having pursued a diploma in computer programming in SENECA COLLEGE. First semester I studied IPC144, CPR101, APS145, ULI101. Second semester I studied DBS211, WEB222, SFT221, OOP244. My favorite course is SFT221 The course SFT221, which involves group assignments, seems particularly interesting. Working in a team on coding projects is invaluable, as it not only improves technical skills but also helps in understanding team dynamics, communication, and collaboration. These are crucial aspects of real-world software development.  </p>
